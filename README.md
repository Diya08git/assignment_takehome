# DataStream, FuelStation, and Calendar

## Description:
This is the description of three programs: DataStream, FuelStation, and Calendar. Each program addresses specific needs, from managing data streams and fuel slots to booking calendar events without overlaps. In Calendar program, ensuring it handles event insertion correctly.

## DataStream Program
### Problem
The initial implementation of the DataStream class did not correctly handle the addition of data points, leading to potential errors in data retrieval and aggregation.

## Solution
### Data Management
Added proper checks and structures to manage the addition and retrieval of data points efficiently. Ensured that data points are stored in a way that allows fast querying and aggregation.

### Query and Aggregation Logic
Implemented efficient algorithms for querying specific data points and aggregating data over specified intervals.

## Steps
### Add Data Point:
Ensure new data points are added correctly without duplications or errors.
### Query Data Point: 
Implement logic to retrieve specific data points efficiently.
### Aggregate Data: 
Implement efficient algorithms to aggregate data over specified intervals
